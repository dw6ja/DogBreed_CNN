# Project Overview

In this project, we will attemp to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. 

The main goal is to construct an image classifier that can differentiate dog's breeds. The model will:
* Accept input from either dog or human image;
* Output predictions of dog's breed if the image is detected to be a dog;
* Output predictions of most resembling dog's breed if the image is detected to be a human.

## Sample Output
